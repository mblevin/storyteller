Far, far away, nestled in the peaks of the Whispering Mountains, is a place known only to the moon and the stars. The mountains are called this because the wind that weaves through the tall, sleepy pine trees never rushes or howls. Instead, it hums a soft, gentle song, a quiet lullaby that has soothed the mountainsides for a thousand years. High up on one of these peaks, tucked away behind a curtain of silvery waterfall mist, is the entrance to a very special cave.

This cave is not dark or cold. As you step inside, the walls glimmer with a life of their own. They are studded with smooth, glowing crystals that pulse with a soft, warm light, painting the cavern in gentle hues of rose-gold and sleepy violet. A thick, springy bed of emerald-green moss lies in the center of the cave, and in the corner, a tiny stream of fresh mountain water trickles over smooth stones, making a peaceful, tinkling sound. This is the home of Ember, and he is a very special kind of dragon.

Ember was not like the dragons from loud, exciting stories. His scales were not jagged and sharp, but smooth and cool like river stones, the color of a deep, mossy forest. His eyes, when they blinked slowly, were the color of warm, liquid honey. And most importantly, when Ember breathed out, he did not breathe fire. Instead, a plume of warm, gentle smoke would drift from his nose. This smoke was magical. It curled in the air like a soft, silvery ribbon and smelled of sweet cinnamon and calming lavender—the scent of a cozy blanket and a field of sleepy flowers all at once.

As twilight began to paint the sky in final streaks of orange and deep purple, Ember padded softly to the mouth of his cave. He rested his chin on the cool stone ledge, feeling the gentle night breeze tickle his nose. He watched as the world below grew quiet and the first star of the evening blinked into view, a tiny diamond on a blanket of deep blue velvet. With a slow, contented sigh, Ember breathed out a soft puff of his cinnamon-lavender smoke, which drifted out into the evening air, carrying a feeling of peace out into the quiet night. He watched, and waited, as the sky prepared to show him all its sparkling secrets.

When the sky was filled with a thousand tiny stars, and the moon had climbed high enough to peek over the mountain peaks, Ember knew it was time. He stretched his great, dark wings, unfurling them slowly and silently, like two great, leathery sails catching the first breath of a gentle breeze. With a soft push from his back legs, he lifted from the ledge. There was no great roar, no powerful flap, just a quiet *whoosh* as the cool night air caught beneath his wings and lifted him up, up, up into the vast, peaceful night.

He glided over the tops of the Whispering Mountains, his dark scales blending with the deep blue of the sky. From high above, the world was a patchwork of soft shadows and silvery light. He soared over the great forest that blanketed the foothills. The moon washed the tops of the pine trees in a pale, gentle glow, making them look like a soft, mossy carpet stretching for miles. The only sound was the deep, quiet whisper of the wind through the pine needles, a sound that had given the mountains their name. Far below, a sleepy owl called out to the moon, its gentle *hoo-hoo* a soft question in the stillness.

Ember followed the path of a winding river, a ribbon of liquid silver snaking through the dark land. It didn't rush or roar, but moved slowly, patiently, on its long journey to the sea. As he dipped lower, he could hear its sleepy murmur, a gentle, shushing sound, like the world itself was breathing a long, slow sigh. The air here was cooler and smelled of damp earth and river stones. He could see the stars reflected on the water's surface, a second sky trembling just below the real one.

Further on, he drifted over a small, quiet village tucked into a sleeping valley. The little houses were dark and still, their windows like closed eyes. A single lantern glowed with a warm, yellow light at the end of a lane, a tiny beacon of coziness in the vast, quiet dark. No sounds came from the village, only the deep, peaceful hum of a world at rest. Ember flew silently over the rooftops, his shadow a fleeting cloud passing before the moon. He felt a deep sense of calm watching over the sleeping homes, knowing that everyone inside was safe and dreaming. He breathed out another slow, gentle puff of his warm smoke, and the scent of cinnamon and lavender drifted down like a soft blanket, carrying sweet dreams to the sleepers below.

Leaving the quiet village behind him, Ember drifted onward, a silent guardian in the velvet sky. His flight took him over a wide, open meadow. The moonlight turned the tall grass into a sea of silver, and every blade was tipped with a tiny, glittering droplet of dew. It was like flying over a field of scattered diamonds, peaceful and perfectly still.

Usually, a meadow like this would be filled with the cheerful, blinking lights of fireflies, dancing their own constellations close to the ground. But tonight, the meadow was strangely dark and quiet. As Ember glided lower, his keen eyes scanned the silvery blades of grass. And then, he noticed something. Not a light, but a tiny, dark shape on the delicate bell of a purple clover flower. The little shape was trembling, and Ember, with his excellent hearing, could just make out the faintest, saddest little sniffle.

A wave of gentleness washed over the great dragon. He angled his wings, catching the cool night air, and began to descend. He landed so softly that the dew on the grass barely trembled. His huge, warm body settled onto the ground with no more sound than a sigh. He lowered his enormous head, moving with incredible slowness, until his nose was just a breath away from the clover. There, huddled on a petal, was the tiniest firefly he had ever seen. Its little wings were drooped, and its tail, where a bright light should have been, was completely dark. The little creature looked up, not with fear, but with a weary sadness. The warm air that washed over it from Ember's breath didn't feel scary at all. It was comforting, and it smelled wonderfully of cinnamon and sleepy lavender.

Ember’s voice, when he spoke, was not a roar. It was a sound more like the gentle shifting of ancient stones, a deep and quiet rumble that vibrated in the air rather than breaking the silence.

“Are you lost, little light?” he rumbled, the sound as soft as a lullaby.

The tiny firefly wiggled its antennae. It didn't seem to have the energy to fly, but it managed a hopeful little buzz, a sound so faint it was like the whisper of a single blade of grass. Ember understood. He lowered his head even further, his great, kind eye blinking slowly.

“I don’t breathe fire,” he explained in that same deep, sleepy murmur. “I breathe warmth. Perhaps… a little warmth is what you need.”

He took a slow, deep breath, tasting the sweet night air. Then, he pursed his great lips, as if he were about to blow a kiss to the moon, and let out the smallest, most gentle puff of smoke. It wasn't a cloud, but a single, perfect wisp, a shimmering curl of warmth that smelled of cinnamon and sleepy lavender. The wisp drifted forward and swirled around the tiny firefly, wrapping it in a soft, fragrant hug.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, in the very center of the firefly's tail, a tiny orange spark appeared, like the last ember in a bedtime fire. The spark grew, not suddenly, but with a slow and steady pulse. It warmed from orange to a soft, buttery yellow. The little creature’s wings gave a happy little flutter, and its light grew brighter still, pulsing with a gentle, golden glow. It was a happy light, a hopeful light.

The firefly, whose name was Flicker, zipped up from the cloverleaf and did a small, joyful loop in the air before landing right on the tip of Ember’s enormous, scaly nose. He felt the tickle of its tiny feet and rumbled a soft, warm chuckle.

“There you are,” Ember whispered. “Now, let’s find your family.”

With the care of a cloud drifting on the breeze, Ember lifted his great head. He rose silently from the meadow, so smoothly that Flicker the firefly barely felt the movement. They floated upwards, into the cool, dark velvet of the night sky. Below them, the meadow became a soft, dark blanket. Ahead, in the far distance, was a faint shimmering, a cluster of blinking lights that looked like a fallen constellation. Ember turned his great head slowly… slowly… and began to fly towards them, a gentle giant with a tiny, living lantern lighting his way.

As they flew, the distant shimmering grew brighter and brighter. It wasn't just a cluster of lights anymore, but a whole river of soft, golden sparks, weaving through the branches of a grand old willow tree by a peaceful, burbling creek. Flicker’s own little light pulsed with excitement on the tip of Ember’s nose. The little firefly knew he was almost home. With a gentle dip of his head, Ember glided down towards the magnificent tree, landing as softly as a falling leaf on the grassy bank.

The air was alive with light. Thousands upon thousands of fireflies floated in the air, clinging to the willow’s long, sweeping branches like tiny lanterns and dancing above the creek like living diamonds. Flicker gave a happy little buzz, his light shining its brightest yet. He flew from Ember’s nose and zipped into the beautiful, swirling cloud of his family. He wasn’t a sad, faded light anymore. He was one of many, a tiny, joyful spark in a galaxy of his own kind.

Then, something magical happened. One by one, then all at once, the thousands of fireflies began to pulse their lights together. A slow, gentle wave of golden light washed over the willow tree, faded into darkness, and then washed over it again. In… and out. A soft, silent rhythm, like a steady, peaceful heartbeat. It was a thank you, sent without a single sound. A wave of pure gratitude that Ember felt deep in his heart, a warmth that had nothing to do with his own smoky breath.

Feeling happy and content, Ember gave a slow, deep nod to the beautiful sight. He turned, and with a quiet push from his powerful legs, he rose back into the dark, velvety sky. He flew back towards the Whispering Mountains, his heart feeling as full and bright as the moon above. The gentle pulsing of the fireflies faded behind him, becoming a warm memory, a perfect end to a perfect night.

Soon, the familiar entrance to his own cozy cave came into view, its crystals giving off a faint, welcoming glow. He landed silently at the entrance and padded softly over to his favorite spot, a thick, springy bed of cool moss. He curled his large, gentle body into a circle, tucking his long tail around himself like a cozy blanket. He let out one last, long, sleepy sigh. A tiny, perfect puff of smoke drifted from his nose, smelling of sweet cinnamon and calming lavender, and it swirled in the air before disappearing. His great, gentle eyes grew heavy… heavier… and finally, they closed.

And as Ember the dragon drifts off to sleep in his cozy cave, you can begin to feel sleepy, too. Just like Ember, you are safe and warm in your own comfortable bed. Feel how soft your pillow is beneath your head, and how cozy the blankets are tucked around you. Feel your own body growing heavy and relaxed… your arms are heavy… your legs are heavy… so very heavy and comfortable.

Take a slow, deep breath in, just like Ember, filling your chest with calm, peaceful air… and then let it all out with a long, soft sigh. Let go of all your thoughts from the day. Imagine them drifting away on a soft, lavender-scented cloud, floating far, far away. There is nothing you need to do now, and nowhere you need to be. There is only the quiet of the night… and the gentle pull of sweet, peaceful dreams. Goodnight.
